# Anxiety-Detection
This project intends to investigate the HAM-A scale's variables and develop a classifier that can predict whether or not a person will experience anxiety. 

GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) patients are too anxious about everyday events and mishaps. Chronic anxiety neurosis is another name for it.

People are suffering from more than only the fatal virus that is causing the current Covid-19 outbreak.
People unintentionally suffer from stress due to the safety of their loved ones, monetary troubles, and other factors, which may lead to the development of disorders like GAD.

A classifier was created using the Hamilton Anxiety Scale as a reference and Deep Learning ideas to predict whether a person would acquire GAD or not.
After the initial Artificial Neural Network model was trained, various additional characteristics that individuals have faced throughout the pandemic (work from home, confinement to their houses, family safety, etc.) were investigated,
allowing a better classifier to be created based on the Hamilton scale.


# Classifier 1

After gathering and analyzing different linked factors and characteristics, we performed data preprocessing to improve our dataset.
The data was then refined and examined. This revised dataset was used to train the first classifier.
The training and testing datasets were divided 75 percent and 25%, respectively.
We achieved an accuracy of 86.32 percent after training the classifier with the training dataset.

# Classifier 2

Data pre-processing was done to refine the data set after assessing the survey and integrating numerous factors and features connected with the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic.
The results of the analysis were based on the improved data set. The improved dataset was used for training the second classifier. 
The training and testing datasets were divided 75 percent and 25%, respectively.
We got 97.33 percent accuracy when we finished training the classifier using the training dataset.
